    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These whimsically named "Booger Cookies" are a delightful treat that
      combines the creamy texture of pistachio pudding with the richness of
      chocolate. The cookies feature a soft, green-tinted base made with
      margarine, sugar, and pistachio pudding mix, studded with chocolate chips
      and topped with a gooey green frosting. Each cookie is finished with a
      chocolate kiss, making them as fun to look at as they are to eat. Perfect
      for Halloween parties or any occasion where you want to add a touch of
      playful grossness to your dessert table!

      <li>1 (3 ounce) package instant pistachio pudding mix</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
        baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat margarine and 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar with an electric mixer
        in a large bowl until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat in the egg, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and almond extract until
        fully incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>Mix in the pudding mix until smooth.</li>
      <li>
        Stir in the flour until just combined, then fold in the chocolate chips,
        mixing enough to combine evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Form the cookie dough into 1-inch balls and place them on the prepared
        baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>Use your thumb to make an indent in each cookie.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 10 to 14 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 1 minute before
        transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the cookies are cooling, prepare the filling by stirring 1 1/2
        cups confectioners' sugar with 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, milk, and
        food coloring in a bowl. Add extra milk as needed to make the mixture
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon a little of the green filling into each cooled cookie and top with
        a candy kiss.
      </li>
    </ol>
